<h2 style='color:#ffe9b4;font-size:1.15em;font-weight:700;'>Our Mission</h2>
<ul style='font-size:1.08em;color:#eaeaea;line-height:1.6em;'>
  <li>To introduce the Five Elements framework in a clear, analytical, and practical way for self-understanding.</li>
  <li>To combine centuries of Eastern wisdom with modern technology and thoughtful design.</li>
  <li>To provide private, user-friendly tools that let anyone explore their personality, natural strengths, and potential through the lens of the Five Elements.</li>
  <li>To foster a global, inclusive community interested in self-discovery and personal growth.</li>
</ul>

<h2 style='color:#ffe9b4;font-size:1.15em;font-weight:700;'>Our Approach</h2>
<p style='font-size:1.08em;color:#eaeaea;'>
The Five Elements—Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, and Water—form a classical system that has guided personal development and understanding in East Asian cultures for centuries. At MyElement, we translate these principles into a user-friendly, data-driven analysis tool designed for the modern age.<br><br>
Our approach is analytical, historical, and personal—not superstitious. We believe that by exploring the balance of the Five Elements in your own life, you can gain valuable insights into your character, relationships, and path forward.
</p>

<h2 style='color:#ffe9b4;font-size:1.15em;font-weight:700;'>Privacy Matters</h2>
<p style='font-size:1.06em;color:#eaeaea;'>
Your information is never stored on our server. Each analysis is generated instantly, securely, and privately. Your trust and privacy are our top priorities.
