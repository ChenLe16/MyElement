We believe personality isn't random—it's shaped by timing, patterns, and nature. Here's how we calculate your Element Star Meter and personal insights:

---

### 1. You enter your birth details.
We ask for your **date and time of birth** because your personality traits are linked to specific natural cycles at the moment you were born—similar to how tides follow the moon, or seasons follow the sun.

---

### 2. We divide your birth time into four parts.
Each part represents a different dimension of your life:
- **Year** → Early environment & social influence  
- **Month** → Work habits & operating style  
- **Day** → Core personality & values  
- **Hour** → Long-term mindset, creativity, and hidden traits

---

### 3. Each part contains natural elements.
Every part of your chart is linked to one or more of the **five elements**:

- 🔥 **Fire** → Emotion, expression, inspiration  
- 🌊 **Water** → Strategy, logic, adaptability  
- 🪵 **Wood** → Growth, vision, learning  
- 🪨 **Earth** → Stability, trust, support  
- ⚙️ **Metal** → Structure, discipline, wealth-building

These elements are used to describe different ways we think, feel, and act.

---

### 4. We count how often each element appears.
We scan all four parts of your chart and count how many times each element shows up. If Water appears a lot, it suggests you have strong strategic thinking. If Fire is missing, emotional expression may take more effort.

---

### 5. We turn that into a star rating.
Your **Element Star Meter** shows how strongly each element influences your personality:

- ★☆☆☆☆ = Minor role  
- ★★★☆☆ = Balanced  
- ★★★★★ = Major influence

This gives you a clear, visual map of what’s naturally strong and what may need nurturing.

---

### 6. We translate the data into insights.
Using your element scores, we generate clear, personalized insights across:

- **Personality** → What drives you  
- **Career** → How you work best  
- **Relationships** → How you connect with others

We don’t tell you who you are—we show you the patterns, so you can decide how to live in alignment with them.
